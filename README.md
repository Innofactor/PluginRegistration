Overview

The Plug-in Registration sample tool (version 5.0) provides a graphical user interface to register Microsoft Dynamics CRM plug-ins and custom workflow activities. The tool supports the following feature set on the
indicated Microsoft Dynamics CRM deployments.

Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011

In addition to these features, the tool provides an easy and interactive method to configure [Windows Azure AppFabric](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/appfabric/) ACS for integration with Microsoft Dynamics CRM. Afterwards, you can register a standard plug-in provided with Microsoft Dynamics CRM to post the current platform operation to the AppFabric Service Bus.

The source code to the program is provided to demonstrate how to use the registration classes provided in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 SDK.

-   Before you deploy applications that make use of this sample code to a production environment, make sure that you consider the existing customizations you may have implemented in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011.
-   There is no longer any support in the tool for command line parameters.
-   The tool supports registering plug-ins or custom workflow activities for custom entities.
